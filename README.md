## Raspberry Pi Demos

This repo contains a web page (`index.html`) which displays an iframe displaying content from a URL defined in `urls.json`.
A file called `name` must be preset at the root with the name of the raspberry pi.
The name of the raspberry pi is used to choose the URL from `urls.py`.
